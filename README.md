## This is my calculator
This is the repo for the calculator I am making for the final project in the foundations section of [*The Odin Project*](https://www.theodinproject.com)
## Main Plan
I have 3 main things I need to accomplish to get this done.

 1. Layout the HTML code with corresponding classes and other misc tags
 2. Make it work with 3 main JS functions, making number buttons add to the text, making operators clear the text and operate, making the "=" button return result
 3. style it
## Post completion Notes
I learned that it's okay to not get it right on the first try. I made a bunch of functions and checks, and then when I looked at it near the end it looked like a bandaid solution so I refactored and made it work a lot better.

CSS still sucks, but it works.
